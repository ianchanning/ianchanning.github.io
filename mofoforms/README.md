# Better Mofo Forms

This is an exercise in [Bootstrap][1] minimalism. Bootstrap is lovely, this is just inpired by it to see what you can achieve with as little as possible. It shows that it&rsquo;s not that hard to get basic forms that look ok. 52 lines of CSS. No HTML classes required. There&rsquo;s further optimisations possible to reduce the lines of code but I&rsquo;m keeping the sections separate.

## Uses

1. With asynchronous CSS you can use it to inline your CSS styles before Bootstrap loads. The HTML behind this is taken from Bootswatch with all the classes taken out - so this will work with your Bootstrap - just without the grid. Only folks on mobile would probably ever notice and you don&rsquo;t need much of a grid on mobile. 
1. You can use it for UX mockups so that clients don&rsquo;t focus on the details but will get an idea of what the application looks like.
