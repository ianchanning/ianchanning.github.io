Right. Let's sort the buyers from the spyers, the needy from the greedy, and those who trust me from the ones who don't, because if you can't see value here today, you're not up here shopping. You're up here shoplifting.
You see these goods? Never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite. Fanny by the gaslight.
Take a bag, c'mon take a bag. I took a bag home last night. Cost me a lot more than ten pound, I can tell you.
Anyone like jewelry? Look at that one there. Handmade in Italy, hand-stolen in Stepney.
It's as long as my arm. I wish it was as long as something else.
Don't think because these boxes are sealed up, they're empty.
The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you lot today, I'd make more money with me measuring tape.
Are you deaf?
Squeeze in if you can. Left leg, right leg, your body will follow. They call it walking.
Treat the wife. Treat somebody else's wife. It's a lot more fun if you don't get caught.
These are not stolen, they just haven't been paid for, and we can't get them again. They've changed the bloody locks.
It's no good coming back later when I've sold out. "Too late, too late" will be the cry when the man with the bargains has passed you by. If you got no money on you now, you'll be crying tears as big as October cabbages.
Shit.
No. I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest! You could fall in love with an orangutan in that!
What d'you think this is? Fucking hide and seek?
I'm not sure what's more worrying. The job or your past.
We've hit the jackpot, lads! We've got God-knows-how-much of this stinking weed, a shitload of cash... and a traffic warden.
You dippy bastard.
