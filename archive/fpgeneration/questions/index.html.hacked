            1. What is fusion power?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               Fusion power promises to produce large amounts of energy at low cost from practically unlimited fuel, with little or no pollution, and to satisfy mankind's energy demands for the
               foreseeable future.
            </p>
            <p>
               Fusion is any nuclear reaction in which two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus with the release of energy via Einstein's famous equivalence of mass and energy E = mc
               <sup>2</sup>. Nuclear fusion powers the sun and other stars.
            </p>
            <p>
               Despite enormous progress in our scientific understanding of fusion, practical power production remains elusive.
            </p>
         </div><a name="question2" id="question2"> </a>
         <h3>
            2. Why is fusion needed when there are plenty of alternative energy sources?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               Controlled fusion power on earth would constitute an environmentally friendly, economically competitive and effectively limitless source of energy.
            </p>
            <p>
               By the turn of the next century, the Earth's population is predicted to reach 12 billion. This unprecedented increase in population, coupled with rising prosperity in the developing
               world will place huge demands on global energy supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
               Fossil fuels, currently our primary source of energy, are beginning to run out, and burning them releases greenhouse gases which is leading to climate change that if unchecked will
               impose unacceptable economic and humanitarian costs on the global population within a generation.
            </p>
            <p>
               Conventional nuclear power (fission) produces long-lived and very hazardous radioactive waste, and the waste material can be used to build nuclear weapons. Furthermore, fuel for
               fission reactors is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
               Renewable energy sources such as wind, wave or solar power provide variable output and are unlikely to ever satisfy total demand. At current costs they are nearly always economically
               uncompetitive with fossil fuels.

            3. Is fusion safe, and how does it differ to fission?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               Both fusion and fission are forms of nuclear energy, but are fundamentally different: fusion is the combination of light nuclei, and fission is the splitting of heavy nuclei.
            </p>
            <p>
               From a safety point of view, with fusion there is absolutely no chance of a runaway reaction like the reaction that destroyed the Chernobyl fission reactor.
            </p>
            <p>
               Fusion requires the active maintenance of plasmas (ionized gases) at extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures, and any departure from these conditions will result in a rapid
               cooling of the reacting plasma and the termination of the reaction. Thus if a fusion reactor malfunctions it will shut down automatically, unlike a fission reactor that can continue to
               operate dangerously after the reactor malfunctions.
            </p>
            <p>
               The fuel for fusion reactions is hydrogen and other light elements that are abundant in seawater and throughout the earth's crust. The fusion of all of the deuterium, a form of
               hydrogen, in the sea could easily meet the expected global energy demand beyond the expected lifetime of the planet. If this demand is met with uranium, the fuel for fission reactors,
               it will be exhausted within twenty to fifty years.
            </p>
            <p>
               The waste from fusion is likely to consist only of small amounts of helium, a completely harmless and in fact useful gas, which can be released into the atmosphere. Waste from fission
               reactors has to be disposed of in securely guarded repositories deep underground, and remains hazardous for tens of thousands of years.

            4. What are we proposing?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               We have a patent for a nuclear fusion reactor based on a design that was the first to demonstrate fusion power production in 1967.
            </p>
            <p>
               This approach, called inertial electrostatic confinement, or IEC, has been abandoned by the mainstream community due to early disappointments in its development and the ostensibly
               greater promise of alternative approaches. We have designed a modification that we believe will solve the problems with the IEC approach.
            </p>
            <p>
               We aim to build a prototype machine that demonstrates net power production within three years of obtaining funding.

            6. What is the state of fusion power development today?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               The accepted consensus in policy and scientific circles is that commercially available fusion power is at least thirty years away.
            </p>
            <p>
               The US fusion budget stands at approximately $250m annually, and the world budget is about ten times as large. The vast majority of this money is being funneled into an international
               mega-project, the construction of a very large tokamak in the South of France called ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. ITER is designed to demonstrate a small net
               energy release within a twenty-year lifetime, and will then be followed by a larger prototype reactor with the aim of producing usable power.
            </p>
            <p>
               The tokamak is a design for a fusion reactor that has been the front-runner in the mainstream fusion community since the 1970s. Tokamaks are large, donut shaped reactors that aim to
               confine hot plasmas using strong magnetic fields. They are necessarily large, complex and expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
               Aside from the tokamak, there are many other design concepts for fusion reactors which have been neglected, abandoned, or even forgotten by the scientific community due to early
               dominance of tokamak-based programs and subsequent funding squeezes.

            7. Why is IEC better?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               IEC promises a cheap, simple approach to commercial fusion power generation that could be developed much, much faster on a modest budget, as compared with a complex, expensive
               multinational project such as ITER.
            </p>
            <p>
               IEC has the additional advantage of being able to use so-called advanced fuels that produce no radiation. The physics of most other fusion reactor designs prevent them from using
               advanced fuels, and other designs are therefore burdened with the necessity of managing large amounts of radiation.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p>
            Despite the merits of IEC, the mainstream magnetic fusion community rejects IEC as unlikely to lead to the development of commercial fusion reactors.

         <h3>
            8. If IEC is so promising why is it not being widely used?
         </h3>
         <div class="content">
            <p>
               Many fusion researchers have never heard of IEC, and most fusion scientists have made their careers in tokamak-related projects.
            </p>
            <p>
               Controversy surrounds the viability of IEC devices. Work published in the last decade apparently calculated that traditional IEC machines could never produce net power. More recent
               work, however, robustly refutes the earlier calculations; in any case no published work exists that takes account of the improvements that we are proposing.

            11. After demonstrating the feasibility of MIX, then what?

         <div class="content">
            <p>
               We will design and build a prototype unit, demonstrating useful power production.
            </p>
            <p>
               The resulting technology can then be licensed to a strategic energy industry player, like <acronym title="General Electric">GE</acronym>, or we can raise money on the capital markets
               to start scale production.
            </p>
            <p>
               Fusion power from a MIX-derived machine would cost significantly less than conventionally generated electricity. Under pessimistic assumptions, IEC energy would cost no more than one
               tenth of conventionally generated power, and will most likely cost even less.
            </p>
            <p>
               The global energy market is currently worth about USD 5 trillion. Commercially viable IEC fusion reactors would capture most of this market.
