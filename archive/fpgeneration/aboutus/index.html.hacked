            Alex is CEO and chief scientist at <acronym title="Fusion Power Generation">FPG</acronym>. In 1999 he invented the <a href="../technology/index.html#mix">MIX</a> concept, which forms the
            basis for the proposed experiments at FPG. Alex earned his PhD in Applied Physics from Columbia University in New York, holds a Masters degree from the University of Texas at Austin, and
            has been working in the field of fusion plasma physics at various institutions and as consultant to private fusion technology firms for over a decade.
         </p>
         <p>
            For several years he was experimental physicist at EMC2, where he worked with R.W. Bussard and N. Krall on Polywell IEC fusion experiments. Currently, he works as research scientist on
            behalf of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is stationed at the largest fusion experiment in the world, the JET tokamak, at the Culham Science Centre in the UK. Alex has
            extensively written articles on fusion and fusion politics, IEC fusion, and is author on numerous peer reviewed papers on tokamak physics.
