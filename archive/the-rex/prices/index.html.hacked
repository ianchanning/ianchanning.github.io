            Rex Random Raffle
         </h2>
         <p>
            On Sell Out nights we open a waiting list 30 minutes before the start time for those
            who just want to try their luck on the door. We will issue each party with a raffle
            ticket and just before the film starts we draw the tickets out of a hat and sell off
            any seats left over. There is a good chance of getting in this way but it is not
            guaranteed. You do not need to arrive 30 mins early as it is a lottery and therefore
            you have as much chance of getting a ticket if you arrive 10 mins before the film.
         </p>

            Terms and Conditions
         </h2>
         <ol>
            <li>There is a credit/debit card booking fee of 50p <strong>per transaction</strong>

            </li>
            <li>All advanced bookings must be collected by <strong>15 mins</strong> after the time
            printed in the programme, after which they may be released for re-sale.

            <li>If you have booked to see a film but are unable to come please give us at least
